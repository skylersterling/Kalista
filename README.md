Kalista is a state-of-the-art stylized realism model that is extremely consistent in generating high quality outputs.

This was meant to be a quick experiment on 'simulating' additional training steps by finding the mean values of multiple different checkpoints that were
trained on separate datasets.

To avoid multiple uploads, this model is only hosted on [hugginface](https://huggingface.co/skylersterling/kalista/tree/main) and [civitai](https://civitai.com/models/4825/kalista). 


While prompting proved quite difficult to maneuver as compared to other models, i was personally blown away by the consistency of the raw quality of 
the images generated:

All the example images provided are 100% raw and were generated in succession from one another. Unfortunately the exact order is lost,
but the point remains the same.

More photo examples can be found in the images folder of this repository. 

Since my GPU is not powerful enough, i am open to including your generated images here. Ofcourse this is completely optional but i would really appreciate it if you could
send me some of your best generations at zehmiel@tutanota.com! Alternatively, you can submit your generations on directly on Civitai: [currently uploading]
